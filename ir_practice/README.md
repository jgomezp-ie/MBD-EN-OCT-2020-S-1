In this practice session, we will implement our own IR system to solve user textual queries over an experimental dataset. We will have three main exercises:
* **Exercise 0:** Create the inverted index of sample documents and then use the Elasticsearch query grammar to search documents (FUNDAMENTAL).
* **Exercise 1:** Use the trec_eval evaluation program to evaluate the quality of the results (OPTIONAL).
* **Exercise 2:** The performance of the previous baseline can be improved in different ways, which include tuning the index setting to add some of the NLP processing that we have learned  in class, e.g., stemming, stopwords, etc. This exercise explores some of such NLP-based optimizations (ADVANCED).
